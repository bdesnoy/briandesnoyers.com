<p>Here I post a variety of simple projects and assignments I have worked on, listed by type.</p>

</h3>

<p>This is a clone of the Space Invaders game I built in Java with a partner as part of the Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 Honors course at Northeastern University.</p>

</h3>

<p>This is a program that finds the optimum employees to influence in a company to spread propaganda within a company, as described in the problem description. The program is written in Python and was written as part of coursework for the Algorithms and Data Structures course at Northeastern University. A greedy algorithm was used to find the solution, as described in the Readme.pdf file. The list of employees was maintained in a priority queue implementation to ensure that it could process a list of ~800,000 employees in under one minute.</p>

</h3>

<p>This is a logo I designed for a new combined athletic and tutoring program for Boston Public High School students, titled Launch.</p>

</h3>

<p>This is an example of an analysis of biological data using the R programming language as part of a Biostatistics course at Northeastern University. The assignment looked at Environmental forcing in Eastern Boundary Current Systems and Temporal trends in upwelling and primary production.</p>
