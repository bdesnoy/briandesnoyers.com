                            Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
                        </p> <p>
                            If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
                            the collection and use of information in relation to this
                            policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
                            used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
                            anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
                        </p> <p>
                            The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
                            as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at

                        </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
                            For a better experience, while using our Service, I
                            may require you to provide us with certain personally
                            identifiable information. The information that
                            I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
                        </p> <!----> <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p> <p>
                            I want to inform you that whenever you
                            use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
                            I collect data and information (through third party
                            products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
                            include information such as your device Internet Protocol
                            (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
                            configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
                            the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
                            statistics. This Service does not collect log data explicitly. 
                            However, the app may use third party code and libraries that 
                            do collect usage information.
                        </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                            commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                            to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                            stored on your device's internal memory.
                        </p> <p>
                            This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                            the app may use third party code and libraries that use
                            “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                            You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
                            and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
                            choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
                            portions of this Service.

                            I may employ third-party companies and
                            individuals due to the following reasons:
                        </p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p>
                            I want to inform users of this Service
                            that these third parties have access to your Personal
                            Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
                            them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                            disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
                        </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                            I value your trust in providing us your
                            Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                            acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                            of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                            storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                            guarantee its absolute security.
                        </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
                            This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
                            a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
                            that these external sites are not operated by me.
                            Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
                            Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
                            no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
                            privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
                            services.

                            These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                            I do not knowingly collect personally
                            identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case
                            I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                            me with personal information, I immediately
                            delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                            and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                            personal information, please contact me so that
                            I will be able to do necessary actions.

                            I may update our Privacy Policy from

                            periodically for any changes. I will
                            notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on

                            not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of

                            by your mobile network provider, but Brian Desnoyers
                            cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                            functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                            have any of your data allowance left.
                        </p> <p></p> <p>
                            If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                            should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                            mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                            be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                            the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                            other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                            responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                            charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                            (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                            you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                            using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                            received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                        </p> <p>
                            Along the same lines, Brian Desnoyers cannot always take
                            responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                            make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                            battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                            Brian Desnoyers cannot accept responsibility.
                        </p> <p>
                            With respect to Brian Desnoyers’s responsibility for your
                            use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                            bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                            updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                            to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                            to you. Brian Desnoyers accepts no liability for any
                            loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                            relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                        </p> <p>
                            At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                            currently available on iOS – the requirements for
                            system(and for any additional systems we
                            decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                            and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                            using the app. Brian Desnoyers does not promise that it
                            will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                            and/or works with the iOS version that you have
                            installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                            accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                            also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                            it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                            Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                            rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                            (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                            from your device.
