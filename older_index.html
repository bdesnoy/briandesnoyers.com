<p>Here I post a variety of simple projects and assignments I have worked on, listed by type.</p>

<a id="current-project-bike-beacon-ios" class="anchor" href="#current-project-bike-beacon-ios" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Current Project: Bike Beacon (iOS)</h3>

<p>I am currently working on a team developing mobile applications to interact with sensors to be deployed on busses and other public transportation vehicles that prevent collisions between these vehicles and bicycles. My role on this team is iOS application developer. For now, all source code for this project is private.</p>

</h3>

<p>This is a clone of the Space Invaders game I built in Java with a partner as part of the Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 Honors course at Northeastern University.</p>

<a id="algorithm-to-maximize-employee-influence-python" class="anchor" href="#algorithm-to-maximize-employee-influence-python" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a href="https://github.com/bdesnoy/bdesnoy.github.io/tree/master/employee_influence_algorithm">Algorithm to Maximize Employee Influence (Python)</a>
</h3>

<p>This is a program that finds the optimum employees to influence in a company to spread propaganda within a company, as described in the problem description. The program is written in Python and was written as part of coursework for the Algorithms and Data Structures course at Northeastern University. A greedy algorithm was used to find the solution, as described in the Readme.pdf file. The list of employees was maintained in a priority queue implementation to ensure that it could process a list of ~800,000 employees in under one minute.</p>

</h3>

<p>This is a bakery management system designed for a fictional client in North Carolina as part of the Object Oriented Design Course at Northeastern University.</p>

</h3>

<p>This is an example of an analysis of biological data using the R programming language as part of a Biostatistics course at Northeastern University. The assignment looked at Environmental forcing in Eastern Boundary Current Systems and Temporal trends in upwelling and primary production.</p>
